# radioman

Just a silly resource tracker project centered on ops radios. If you're looking
at this, chances are you know why you need it.

Yes, it's full of bugs. Yes, there are security implications. I don't recommend
running this anywhere but locally until I learn more about how Nuxt, NuxtHub,
and Vue work.

# Nuxt Template Stuff
